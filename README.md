Supernicejohn - backend text editing


On backend we could have a save/load function on server
+communications
on client ui + communications
so I think somebody could do the protocol and a good comm lib
somebody the UI and syntax highlight
somebody the client backend for functions like replace, clipboard etc
somebody the server backend for save/load and permissions and these organisation stuff
